# Dask for Geospatial Analysis: Efficient Parallel Workflows for Satellite Imagery in Sherlock
Brought to you by the [SDSS Center for Computation](https://sdss-compute.stanford.edu) and [Love Data Week at the Stanford Libraries](https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/).
Thursday, Feb. 12th in the Branner Earth Sciences Library from 1-2pm ([Please RSVP](https://appointments.library.stanford.edu/event/15881415))

In today's workshop we are going to cover how to interact with satellite data that is larger than the onboard memory of a single core in distributed HPC environments such as Sherlock. This will provide you with a reliable framework to query for only the pixels that you are interested in from open satellite imagery datasets like Landsat. You will learn how to build and run custom functions on these images, and how to process targeted, machine-learning ready datasets.

### Today's Tutorial Agenda:
1. Launch an interactive Jupyter Lab session on Sherlock using [Open OnDemand](https://ondemand.sherlock.stanford.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/sh_jupyterlab/session_contexts/new)
2. Install a Custom Jupyter Lab Kernel from a Container
3. What is `dask` and how does it distribute data? [[tutorial](https://github.com/stanford-sdss/hpc_tutorials/blob/main/dask-for-geospatial-data/dask_for_geospatial.ipynb)]
4. Interacting with large satellite imagery using `dask` [[tutorial](https://github.com/stanford-sdss/hpc_tutorials/blob/main/dask-for-geospatial-data/dask_for_geospatial.ipynb)]
5. Running custom functions on select pixels using `dask` + `xarray` [[tutorial](https://github.com/stanford-sdss/hpc_tutorials/blob/main/dask-for-geospatial-data/dask_for_geospatial.ipynb)]
